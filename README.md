# Introduction to Using Docker and Containerizing Applications

Docker is a platform that enables developers to build, share, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent environments that package an application and its dependencies together.

## Why Use Docker?
- **Portability**: Run your application anywhere Docker is installed.
- **Consistency**: Eliminate "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Efficiency**: Containers use fewer resources compared to virtual machines.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications with container orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

## Key Concepts
- **Image**: A lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.
- **Container**: A runtime instance of a Docker image.
- **Dockerfile**: A script that defines how to build a Docker image.
- **Docker Hub**: A repository for sharing Docker images.
